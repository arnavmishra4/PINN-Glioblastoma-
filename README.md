## Why Physics Decodes Glioblastoma Dynamics

Structural MRI segmentation (M1) outlines visible tumor borders — but captures only a static snapshot. Glioblastoma is highly infiltrative: malignant cells reside far beyond what any standard scan can resolve.

M2 bridges that gap by fitting the **Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (Fisher-KPP) partial differential equation** to each patient's imaging data. The result is a set of patient-specific biophysical parameters that reveal how aggressively a tumor is proliferating versus invading surrounding tissue.

When a follow-up scan becomes available, M2 tracks the **shifts** (Δ-deltas) in these parameters across time. This biophysical signature is the primary input used by M3 to distinguish true tumor progression from treatment-induced pseudoprogression — a distinction that standard volumetric comparison cannot reliably make.

## Architecture & Pipeline

```
M1 Segmentation Mask + Radii (R_T1Gd, R_FLAIR)
  │
  ├─ Step 1: Radii Ratio Grid Search
  │     └─ Estimates characteristic parameters (D̄/ρ̄, L̄) from spatial tumor boundaries
  │
  ├─ Step 2: FDM Pre-Training
  │     └─ PINN pre-trained on Finite Difference Method characteristic solutions (~30 min)
  │
  ├─ Step 3: Patient-Specific Fine-Tuning
  │     └─ Fine-tunes on M1 segmentation boundaries as direct supervision signal
  │
  └─ Output
        ├─ μ_D  — Normalized diffusion / invasion ratio
        ├─ μ_R  — Normalized proliferation / growth ratio
        ├─ γ    — Go-Grow Index (μ_R / μ_D)
        └─ u(x,t) — Full 3D continuous tumor cell density map
```

### Key Parameters

**μ_D (Diffusion Ratio)** — Non-dimensional index of invasion-dominant spread along brain tissue. Learned within the physics-consistent range [0.75, 1.25].

**μ_R (Proliferation Ratio)** — Non-dimensional index of cellular reproduction and growth rate. Bounded symmetrically with μ_D.

**γ (Go-Grow Index)** — Defined as μ_R / μ_D. Captures the balance between a tumor's migratory drive and its replicative drive as a single scalar.

---

## Execution Logic

M2 runs independently on each longitudinal scan. Its downstream behavior differs by timeline stage.

### Scan 1 — Baseline

- Fits μ_D, μ_R, γ from the initial imaging boundaries
- Solves the PDE forward to generate a 3D predicted density map for the next interval
- Persists parameters, timestamp, and density map into LangGraph patient state

### Scan 2 — Delta Computation

- Re-estimates parameters from the follow-up MRI volume
- Retrieves Scan 1 parameters from state and computes Δμ_D, Δμ_R, Δγ
- Passes deltas to M3 as primary classification features

> **Design note on temporal modeling:** The PDE operates in normalized, non-dimensional time. Absolute forward-time spatial predictions are not used for classification because the end-time t_end cannot be reliably anchored. The parameter deltas themselves carry the biological signal — this is an explicit architectural choice, not a limitation workaround.

---

## Biophysical Delta Signals

The parameter shifts between Scan 1 and Scan 2 carry specific clinical meaning consumed by the M3 classifier and the NeuroBio Agent.

| Pattern | Biological Interpretation | Expected Action |
|---|---|---|
| **μ_R ↓, μ_D ↓** | True treatment response — both proliferation and invasion suppressed | Continue current protocol |
| **μ_R ↓, μ_D ↑** | Dangerous infiltrative spread — cells dispersing outward rather than dying | Urgent flag; high recurrence probability |
| **μ_R ↑, μ_D stable** | Proliferation-dominant true progression; therapeutic resistance | Treatment failing — initiate reassessment |
| **μ_R stable, μ_D ↑** | Invasion-dominant progression along white matter tracts | Close monitoring of affected subregions |

## Engineering Notes

**Convergence gate** — The LangGraph agent validates that optimized μ_D and μ_R fall within [0.75, 1.25] before passing outputs downstream. Diverged runs are caught at this node.

**Fallback routing** — If the PINN fails to converge within tolerance, the agent automatically routes to radiomics-only features for M3, injects an uncertainty flag into the clinical report, and signals the NeuroBio Agent to adjust its hypothesis strategy. The pipeline does not crash.

**Compute** — PDE grid search + iterative optimization requires ~30 minutes per patient volume on standard GPU. Plan accordingly for batch inference.

---

## Limitations

- **Simplified biology** — Fisher-KPP models diffusion and proliferation only. Mass effect, necrosis, and antiangiogenic therapeutic responses are not represented.
- **Temporal non-dimensionality** — Absolute forward-time spatial boundaries cannot be perfectly matched; this is a known property of the normalized PDE formulation, not a convergence failure.
- **GBM-specific** — Parameters and constraints are calibrated for GBM dynamics. Applying this model to other tumor types requires re-engineering the underlying PDE and re-validating bounds.
